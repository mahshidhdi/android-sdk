# Code Style

We follow the following two coding style guidelines

1. https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html
2. https://android.github.io/kotlin-guides/style.html

If the two guides have conflicting opinions on a matter, guide (2) will take precedence.

Further coding style guidelines may be placed in the remainder of this section. Anything here takes precedence over the linked guides.
